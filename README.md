# Duplicate Question Detection (DQD)

# Overview
DQD is a model which will tell whether two questions are semantically similar or not. In this project, we tried to build some models using several machine learning algorithms.
We used certain similarity measures like cosine similarity, jaccard similarity etc. for checking the similarity of the two questions.

# Pre-requisites:
1. Python
2. Machine Learning
3. Deep Learning
4. Natural Language Processing

# Applications
DQD can be used on any forums for example stackoverflow, quora etc. so that duplicate questions can be eliminated.
